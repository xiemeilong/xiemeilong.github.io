As I began to love myself

当我真正开始爱自己，

不论是饮食和人物，还是事情和环境，

and everything that drew me down and away from myself.

我远离一切让我远离本真的东西。

At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism.

Today I live each day, day by day,

今天，我活在此时此地，

and I call it

如此日复一日。这就叫

​

As I began to love myself

当我开始真正爱自己，

I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick.

我明白，我的思虑让我变得贫乏和病态，

But as I connected it to my heart,

但当我唤起了心灵的力量，

my mind became a valuable ally.

理智就变成了一个重要的伙伴，

Today I call this connection

这种组合我称之为，

WISDOM OF THE HEART.

“心灵的智慧”。

​

We no longer need to fear arguments,

confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others.

That is LIFE!

这就是“生命”！
